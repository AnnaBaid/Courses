            From employees to students, these are people who adore what they do
            and try to improve something every day, not only in themselves but
            also in their approach to work, work, and communication.

            EasyPeasy is the School of Programming. They supported and helped me
            not only at the initial stage of learning, but also after. The team
            is interested in the success of their students.

It is very cool that there is such a school where you can easily learn a new profession from scratch. At first, I didn't even believe that I would get in, but my worries were in vain. I got into Mate academy and less than six months later I was invited to an internship at an IT company.
